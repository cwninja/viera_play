module Rack

  # Middleware that allows your Rack app to keep tabs on devices that the
  # {UPnP::ControlPoint} has found.  UPnP devices that match the +search_type+
  # are discovered and added to the list, then removed as those devices send out
  # +ssdp:byebye+ notifications.  All of this depends on +EventMachine::Channel+s,
  # and thus requires that an EventMachine reactor is running.  If you don't
  # have one running, the {UPnP::ControlPoint} will start one for you.
  #
  # @example Control all root devices
  #
  #   Thin::Server.start('0.0.0.0', 3000) do
  #     use Rack::UPnPControlPoint, search_type: :root
  #
  #     map "/devices" do
  #       run lambda { |env|
  #         devices = env['upnp.devices']
  #         friendly_names = devices.map(&:friendly_name).join("\n")
  #         [200, {'Content-Type' => 'text/plain'}, [friendly_names]]
  #       }
  #     end
